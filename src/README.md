   - Run `npm run build` to create a production build of your app.

2. **Purchase a domain name**:
   - Choose and register a domain name from a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.

3. **Choose a hosting service**:
   - Select a web hosting service such as Netlify, Vercel, AWS, GitHub Pages, or any other that supports static site hosting.

4. **Deploy your site**:
   - Follow your hosting service's instructions to deploy the production build of your site.

5. **Update DNS Settings**:
   - Configure the DNS settings for your domain to point to your hosting service's servers. This process will vary depending on your registrar and hosting service.

6. **Verify search engine indexing**:
   - Submit your new domain to search engines like Google by using tools like Google Search Console to ensure your website is indexed.

Remember, each hosting service will have specific instructions and tools to facilitate the deployment process, so be sure to refer to their documentation for detailed guidance.
